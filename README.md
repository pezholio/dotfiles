# My Dotfiles

It's about time I started doing this properly

## Setup

I decided not to use a framework for now, so setting up is as simple as cloning
the repo in your home directory like so:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pezholio/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

And then run the setup script to install the dependencies and set everything up:

```bash
sudo script/bootstrap
```
